# Welcome to Office Cocktail

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Tech Stack

React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI

### Info

A website to lookup popular cocktails and how to make them. For every cocktail, there are ingredients and a receipe included. You can also spin up random cocktails in order to get some insight on what to include in your bar. The employee concept here was inspired by characters from The Office, hence the name. Random employees can be added and each employee will have an attached Favourite drink to him or her. I wanted this to be an opportunity to include Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query in my project for state management. This was also a platform for me to practice DaisyUI, where I have included 4 DaisyUI Themes for the user to switch around. Synthwave and Cyberpunk are my favourites!
